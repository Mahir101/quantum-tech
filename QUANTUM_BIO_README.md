## 🚀 The Vision
This project aims to "mash up" the probabilistic nature of **Quantum Computing** with the topological complexity of **Biological Systems**. By treating DNA as a quantum search space and Proteins as "Biological Origami," we can move beyond the classical limits of AlphaFold and enter the era of **Quantum Proteomics**.

## 🏗️ Core Algorithms & Methodologies

### 1. Quantum DNA Analytics (Q-Genomics)
Traditional DNA sequence alignment (like BLAST) is computationally expensive. We leverage quantum search to achieve quadratic speedups.
*   **Grover’s Pattern Matching:** Using Grover’s algorithm to locate specific genetic markers in unindexed genomic data.
*   **Quantum Walks on DNA:** Using Quantum Random Walks to model the diffusion of transcription factors across the double helix.
*   **De Novo Assembly (Quantum Annealing):** Formulating the DNA assembly problem as a QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problem for D-Wave systems.

### 2. Protein Origami (Quantum Folding)
While AlphaFold 2/3 uses Geometric Deep Learning, **Quantum Bio-Origami** uses the physics of the quantum state to simulate the "folding" energy landscape.
*   **VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver):** Calculating the ground-state energy of amino acid interactions to find the most stable "folded" state.
*   **Lattice Models (HP Model):** Mapping the Hydrophobic-Polar model of proteins onto a quantum chip where each qubit represents the "bend" or "twist" of the protein backbone.
*   **Quantum Geometric Deep Learning:** Integrating Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) with E(3)-equivariant graphs to predict protein-ligand binding with sub-atomic precision.

## 🧪 Implementation Stack
To build this, we integrate the following frameworks:
*   **[Qiskit Nature](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-nature/):** For simulating molecular interactions and protein folding.
*   **[BioPython](https://biopython.org/):** For handling the `.pdb` (Protein Data Bank) and `.fasta` (Genomic) file formats.
*   **[PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/):** For quantum machine learning applications in genomics.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
- `src/bio/dna_search.py`: Implementation of Grover's algorithm for pattern matching in DNA sequences.
- `src/bio/protein_origami.py`: Lattice-based protein folding simulation using VQE concepts.
- `data/bio/`: (To be created) Storage for genomic sequences and protein structures.

## 🤝 Contributing
We are looking for:
- **Bio-informaticians** who understand protein geometry.
- **Quantum Engineers** specializing in QUBO and VQE.
- **Data Chemists** who can bridge the gap between `.mol` files and Hilbert Space.

*"The next 100 years of biology will be written in the language of qubits."*
